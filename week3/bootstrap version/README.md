# Kyla Beltran | Assignment 3

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates two versions of my personal portfolio:  

1. **Manual Responsive Design** 
2. **Bootstrap Responsive Design**
---

## Code Complexity Comparison
The **manual version** required writing CSS for breakpoints, image scaling, and layout adjustments. It gave me full control over every detail. I personally prefer working this version over the Bootstrap version.

The **Bootstrap version** was easier to set up since most of the responsive behavioris built in. I mostly used utility classes, the grid system, and pre-styled components.

**Conclusion:** Manual is more complex but it gives me more control. However, Bootstrap is simpler and faster.

## Development Time Analysis
- **Manual version:** Took longer because it has more components to it but I was having fun customizing and being able to control the little details.  
- **Bootstrap version:** Took less time because Bootstrap already has ready-to-use grids, components, and responsive utilities. I mainly applied classes and tuned a few styles so it matches my Manual version.

## Pros & Cons

### Manual Responsive Design
**Pros:**  
- Full control over every detail.  
- Custom design can be achieved precisely.  
- Great learning experience for CSS.

**Cons:**  
- More time-consuming.  
- More code to maintain.  
- Some inconsistencies on breakpoints.

### Bootstrap Responsive Design
**Pros:**  
- Fast and efficient.  
- Behavior is consistent.  
- Needs less CSS maintenance.  
- It has prebuilt components.

**Cons:**  
- Less flexibility for custom design.  
- Can be harder to deviate from Bootstrap defaults.  
- Relied heavily on external library.

## Personal Preference & Reasoning
I personally prefer the **manual version** because I enjoy controlling the design, little details and customizing layouts exactly how I want. However, I understand how important Bootstrap is for projects that needs faster development and reliable responsive behavior. For real world scenarios with tight deadlines, Bootstrap would be ideal, but for learning and experimentation, manual version CSS is more enjoyable.
