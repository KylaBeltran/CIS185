# Week 1 Assignment 1 – HTML Elements Exploration

**Student Name:** Kyla Andrea Beltran  
**Course:** CIS 185  
**Assignment One:** Explore HTML Elements  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of various HTML elements beyond the basics we covered in class.  
I created a web page showcasing 5 HTML elements with semantic meaning and custom CSS styling.

## HTML Elements Implemented
1. `<abbr>`
**Purpose:** Displays an abbreviation
**How I used it:** Marked acronyms like HTML and CSS with full descriptions  
**Why it's useful:** Improves accessibility and helps users understand abbreviations
```
<p>The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> structure is the backbone of webpages.</p>
```

2. `<mark>` 
**Purpose:** Highlights important text 
**How I used it:** Emphasized key terms in paragraphs
**Why it's useful:** Makes important information stand out visually
```
<p>Learning <mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark> is essential for web development.</p>
```

3. `<details>` + `<summary>`
**Purpose:** Creates interactable content sections
**How I used it:** Added a “Fun Fact” section that users can expand
**Why it's useful:** Saves space while keeping content organized
```<details>
        <summary>Click me for a Fun Fact!</summary>
        <p>The first website ever created is still online today!</p>
    </details>
```

4. `<progress>`
**Purpose:** Shows task completion progress visually
**How I used it:** Displayed my HTML & CSS learning progress
**Why it's useful:** Gives a visual indicator of completion or loading status
```
<progress value="10" max="100">10% Complete</progress> 
```

5. `<blockquote>` 
**Purpose:** Adds a section for marking quotes from another source
**How I used it:** Added a famous quote
**Why it's useful:** Marks quotes and improves readability
``` <blockquote cite="https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5057/">
        “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>—Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
```
